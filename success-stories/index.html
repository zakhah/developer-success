                        <p>Our company wanted to change our website over to WordPress without losing our branding. I just needed something simple, yet professional that looked like our old site. Since web designers can be expensive (and can sometimes disappear), I hesitated for a long time to find one.
                                Natalie Washington was very responsive and gave me just what I wanted for my perfect company website. When tech problems came up she helped us work through them in a way that was commendable.
                                I would definitely recommend her service and look forward to future projects with her.

                        <p>Natalie, what a privilege and delight to work with you!  Thank you for nurturing this right-brained artist/minister into the world of websites!  You reassured me when I was totally clueless about technology and have provided me with the educational tools needed to keep going.  I deeply appreciate your efficiency, artistry, persistence and patience.  I will be recommending you to friends and colleagues.  And, no doubt, returning for help! Thanks again! Blessings,
